# Midnight's Owls Detector

There are such creatures on the [Devman.org](https://devman.org) - Midnight's Owls

Midnight's Owls learn at night and send their solutions to the tasks from 00:00 to 06:00.

This script will show their names.

# How to install
Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Quick start

```bash
$ python3 seek_dev_nighters.py
```

Running on Windows is similar.

*(Possibly requires call of 'python' executive instead of just 'python3'.)*

# Example
```bash
$ python3 seek_dev_nighters.py
